Review C++
===

I need a strong C++ background for 2D/3D programming. Even though I've taken a rush c++ cours in first year of master, but that's not enough. This time I follow the classic "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" by the creator of language, and I will make some openGL & cocos2D projects at the same time.
